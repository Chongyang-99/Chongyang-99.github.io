        My research focuses on **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** models, **3D pre-trained foundation models as world models**, and **dual-arm collaborative manipulation** algorithms, with previous work in human motion capture and crowd analysis.

        I am currently a Research Intern at **Dexmal (原力灵机)**, working on bimanual manipulation policies with 3D representations and large-scale VLA evaluation on real-robot benchmarks.
